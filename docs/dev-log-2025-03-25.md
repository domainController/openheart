## 🧠 Context & Vision

Today marked a foundational step in Proposal’s technical development: we completed and validated the **first functional profile form submission** using Algolia + a simulated Supabase API. This marks a moment where the project transitions from static UI exploration to **real, structured data capture**.

The motivation for this step was both technical and philosophical:

- Technically, we needed to ensure we could transmit, format, and log user data.
- Philosophically, we are crafting a human-centered onboarding process, where **every field has a purpose, a verification logic, and a monetization intent**.

## ✅ Key Achievements

- Fully working dropdowns connected to 3 Algolia indexes: `romantic_status`, `commitment_expectations`, and `parental_status`.
- Dropdowns display both the **title** and **explanatory label** with clear UI formatting.
- Introduced `has_children` as a **boolean flag** controlling conditional rendering of `parental_status`.
- Designed `handleSave()` to bundle all fields into a clean `payload` object.
- Routed the POST request to `/api/save-profile` where it was successfully **logged in the API route**.

## ⚙️ Technical Design

### ➕ Fields Saved

```ts
{
  first_name: string,
  last_name: string,
  username: string,
  birth_date: string,
  calculated_age: number,
  has_children: boolean,
  romantic_status: objectID,
  commitment_expectations: objectID,
  parental_status?: objectID // if has_children is true
}
```

### 🔁 Conditional Logic

```ts
if (hasChildren) {
  showParentalStatusDropdown = true;
} else {
  showParentalStatusDropdown = false;
}
```

## 📝 Commit Message

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "✨ First profile save with conditional parental_status logic + payload API simulation"
```

## 📁 Folder Structure

We created a dedicated route file at:

```
app/api/save_profile/route.ts
```

In future iterations, this will be connected to Supabase or an ORM like Prisma.

## 📚 Why This Matters

- Enables full-stack test of a functional `userBasicInfo` interface.
- Demonstrates dynamic logic (boolean + dropdown)
- Lays the groundwork for **data monetization**, **verification services**, and **tiers (Access/Core)** by showing conditional UX

## 📌 Next Steps

- Connect actual Supabase logic (user table + `id`)
- Auto-generate `user_id`
- Add timestamp to each profile
- Separate CSS (Tailwind external classes)
- Versioning for each profile
