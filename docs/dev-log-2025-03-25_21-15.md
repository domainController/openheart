## 🌙 Overnight Ideas Recap (user dictation)

1. **Create a new branch without Algolia** to avoid billing, and use it to explore non-Algolia implementations. Helps determine which fields actually need Algolia later.
2. **Develop `number_of_existing_children` input**, integrate it as a Core Check and place it among the first questions asked.
3. **Enable individual field saving** in OpenHART and allow loading of profile data via `user_id` or `profile_id`.
4. **Clarify distinction between user_id and profile_id**, and possibly adopt `profile_id` as the clearer term.
5. **Create narrative descriptions** from grouped profile fields (e.g. children info → one sentence), like a product description rather than a UI grid.
6. **Integrate real-life use cases** daily to remain grounded in user reality and generate new insights.
7. **Introduce concept clarifiers** (like definitions of “commit”, “hook”, “handleSubmit”, etc.) with context, history, and usage, multiple times per day.

## ✅ To-Do List for Today

- [ ] Create branch `no-algolia-dev` based on current test environment
- [ ] Build and integrate `NumberOfExistingChildrenInput`
- [ ] Update logic for individual field saving (Supabase or local state)
- [ ] Display user_id or profile_id at top of form (clarify terminology)
- [ ] Prototype sentence-generation feature for grouped fields (e.g., children section)
- [ ] Add 1–2 real-life use cases to shape data model
- [ ] Define and display 1 key concept from Git/React (ex: `commit`) with explanation

## 🧠 Notes

- The sentence-style output is key to UX vision (Care of Carl inspiration).
- Logging and micro-documentation are vital — markdown logs will remain our core system.
- Daily definitions could be displayed inline, in terminal, or written to a `docs/concepts/` folder.
