# ðŸ•“ Dev Log â€” 2025-03-25 @ 02:43

## Context

First structured development journal file with timestamp in the filename and header. This new structure helps keep track of documentation entries throughout the same day, especially when multiple logs are added at different hours.

## Summary of the Action

- Confirmed importance of including **hour** in dev log file names.
- Created `dev-log-2025-03-25_02-43.md` in the `/docs` directory.
- Validated that naming convention includes: `dev-log-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm.md`
- Confirmed content header replicates the same timestamp for clarity.

## Why it Matters

This format gives:

- A precise view of **when** logs were written.
- The ability to retrace the developerâ€™s train of thought and key decision points.
- Future teammates and product buyers more clarity on how the app was progressively built.

## Next Steps

- Add a terminal alias like `devlognow` to auto-create a timestamped dev log.
- Keep using this format consistently.

Letâ€™s now set up a terminal command that generates this type of log file with timestamp and opens it directly in VS Code.
